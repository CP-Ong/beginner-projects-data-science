# Beginner Data Science Projects

This repository is a collection of beginner-level projects in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These projects are guided through the [Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) on Udemy. The primary goal of this repository is to track my learning progress and demonstrate my skills, motivation, and commitment.

## Purpose
I am currently enhancing my knowledge in data science, AI, and machine learning. Through this repository, I aim to:
- Apply the concepts learned in the course.
- Showcase practical problem-solving abilities.
- Demonstrate progress in mastering various data science techniques.
- Build a portfolio of projects to present to employers.
<!--
## Projects Overview
The projects in this repository cover a range of topics, including but not limited to:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical Analysis
- Supervised Learning (Regression and Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Deep Learning (Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)-->
