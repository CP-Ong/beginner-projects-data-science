# Beginner Data Science Projects

This repository is a collection of beginner-level projects in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These projects are guided through the [Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) on Udemy. The primary goal of this repository is to track my learning progress and demonstrate my motivation and commitment.

## Purpose
I am currently enhancing my knowledge in data science, AI, and machine learning. Through this repository, I aim to:
- Apply the concepts learned in the course.
- Showcase practical problem-solving abilities.
- Demonstrate progress in mastering various data science techniques.
- Build a portfolio of projects to present to employers.

## Projects
### [Project 1: Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning (Classification)](Classification_Heart-Disease)
  > Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

The original data came from the Cleveland data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).
A version of it is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data).

### [Project 2: Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers Using Machine Learning (Regression_Time-Series-Data)](Regression_Bulldozer-Price)
  > How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

The original data came from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data).

### [Project 3: Multi-Class Dog Breed Classification (Image_Classification)](Image-Classification_Dog-Vision)
  > Given an image of a dog, can we identify the breed of the dog?

The original data came from the [Kaggle's dog breed identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data).

## Projects Overview
